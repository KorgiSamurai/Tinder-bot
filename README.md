# Tinder-bot
Tinder bot. All is automatically 

IMPORTANT: Starring the project indicates shows your appreciation and will result in new features being added!

This project started with the motivation of learning web automation further and scraping with Python.
I managed to succesfully create a bot that could: 

Open a browser and login to Tinder.com
Setting a custom location for FREE (which is normally a paid-for-Tinder Plus-feature)
Setting profile settings and preferences, such as distance radius, minimum and maximum age, sexuality.
Accept all notifications and dismiss pop-ups
Swiping x number of profiles left or right
Scraping data of the profiles displayed, including, yet not limited to, name, age, bio, images, ...
Sending personalized messages to your matches
Sending you social media cards, like Instagram, Snapchat, Phonenumber and Facebook
Sending GIFS and songs
Unmatching
If you feel like diving right in, the quickstart.py will help you be right on track.
If you're new to coding and just want the script to automatically like, the auto_swipe.py would be what you're looking for!
Feel free to make a pull request and contribute to this project!

Enjoy! :)
